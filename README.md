# ![udacity](udacity.jpg) Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations :heavy_check_mark:

### Project 1: Your first neural network :heavy_check_mark:
In this project, you'll build and train your own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

### Project 2: Image Classification :heavy_check_mark:
Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a convolutional neural network.

### Project 3: Generate TV Scripts :heavy_check_mark:
Generate a TV script using a recurrent neural network.

### Project 4: Translation Project :heavy_check_mark:
Use a neural network to translate from one language to another.

### Project 5: Generate Faces :heavy_check_mark:
Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate novel faces.
